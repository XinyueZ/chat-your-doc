      "Summary: Nvidia Corporation (, en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world's third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe Wikipedia search provided an overview of what GPUs are and their various applications, including cryptocurrency mining and AI, but it did not provide specific data on the global demand for GPUs from 2010 to 2023.

Miners receive rewards for performing computationally intensive work, such as calculating hashes, that amend and verify transactions on an open and decentralized ledger. GPUs can be especially performant at calculating such hashes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Graphics processing unit\\nSummary: A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing (either on a video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles). After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.\\n\\nPage: Nvidia\\nSummary: Nvidia Corporation (, en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.Nvidia\\'s professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia\\'s offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world\\'s third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.'</span>\n",

      "Summary: Nvidia Corporation (, en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world's third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.\n",

It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.Nvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world's third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.\\n\\nPage: PlayStation models\\nSummary: A number of models of Sony's PlayStation (PS) video game console were produced from 1994 to 2006.

They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world's third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.\\n\\nPage: PlayStation models\\nSummary: A number of models of Sony's PlayStation \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPS\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m video game console were produced from 1994 to 2006.

Miners receive rewards for performing computationally intensive work, such as calculating hashes, that amend and verify transactions on an open and decentralized ledger. GPUs can be especially performant at calculating such hashes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Graphics processing unit\\nSummary: A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing (either on a video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles). After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.\\n\\nPage: Nvidia\\nSummary: Nvidia Corporation (, en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.Nvidia\\'s professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering and PC gaming. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet) and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.In addition to GPU design and manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing, e.g. Nvidia Maxine.Nvidia\\'s offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and, as of March 2024, it is the world\\'s third most-valuable company after Microsoft and Apple, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion.'</span>,\n",

      "Models (PGMs) in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\n",
      "  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\n",
      "global economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\n",
      "industrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\n",

      "learning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\n",
      "understand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\n",
      "affecting crude oil markets and how they are \\textit{causally} related. The\n",
      "second challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\n",
      "data and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\n",
      "The third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\n",

Alvi\\nSummary: The dissertation investigates the application of Probabilistic Graphical\\nModels (PGMs) in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\\n  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\\nglobal economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\\nindustrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit{causally} related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources (RES) has severe (financial and other) implications for energy market\\nplayers. In this paper, we present a device-level Demand Response (DR) scheme\\nthat captures the atomic (all available) flexibilities in energy demand and\\nprovides the largest possible solution space to generate demand/supply\\nschedules that minimize market imbalances. We evaluate the effectiveness and\\nfeasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility\\nanalysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is\\nmore concerned with the \\\\textit{utility} that the demand flexibility brings to\\nthe market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy. In this regard, we\\nprovide comprehensive predictive modeling and scheduling of demand flexibility\\nfrom household appliances to demonstrate the (financial and otherwise)\\nviability of introducing flexibility-based DR in the Danish/Nordic market.\\nFurther, we investigate the correlation between the potential utility and the\\naccuracy of the demand forecast model. Furthermore, we perform a number of\\nexperiments to determine the data granularity that provides the best financial\\nreward to market players for adopting the proposed DR scheme. A cost-benefit\\nanalysis of forecast results shows that even with somewhat low forecast\\naccuracy, market players can achieve regulation cost savings of 54% of the\\ntheoretically optimal.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-09-27\\nTitle: A City-centric Approach to Estimate and Evaluate Global Urban Air Mobility Demand\\nAuthors: Lukas Asmer, Roman Jaksche, Henry Pak, Petra Kokus\\nSummary: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is expected to effectively complement the existing\\ntransportation system by providing fast and safe travel options, contributing\\nto decarbonization, and providing benefits to citizens and communities.

Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPGMs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit\u001b[0m\u001b[32m{\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcausally\u001b[0m\u001b[32m}\u001b[0m\u001b[32m related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mRES\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m has severe \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfinancial and other\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m implications for energy market\\nplayers.

Alvi\\nSummary: The dissertation investigates the application of Probabilistic Graphical\\nModels (PGMs) in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\\n  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\\nglobal economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\\nindustrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit{causally} related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources (RES) has severe (financial and other) implications for energy market\\nplayers. In this paper, we present a device-level Demand Response (DR) scheme\\nthat captures the atomic (all available) flexibilities in energy demand and\\nprovides the largest possible solution space to generate demand/supply\\nschedules that minimize market imbalances. We evaluate the effectiveness and\\nfeasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility\\nanalysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is\\nmore concerned with the \\\\textit{utility} that the demand flexibility brings to\\nthe market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy.

Alvi\\nSummary: The dissertation investigates the application of Probabilistic Graphical\\nModels \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPGMs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\\n  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\\nglobal economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\\nindustrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPGMs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit\u001b[0m\u001b[32m{\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcausally\u001b[0m\u001b[32m}\u001b[0m\u001b[32m related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mRES\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m has severe \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfinancial and other\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m implications for energy market\\nplayers.

Alvi\\nSummary: The dissertation investigates the application of Probabilistic Graphical\\nModels (PGMs) in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\\n  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\\nglobal economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\\nindustrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit{causally} related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources (RES) has severe (financial and other) implications for energy market\\nplayers. In this paper, we present a device-level Demand Response (DR) scheme\\nthat captures the atomic (all available) flexibilities in energy demand and\\nprovides the largest possible solution space to generate demand/supply\\nschedules that minimize market imbalances. We evaluate the effectiveness and\\nfeasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility\\nanalysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is\\nmore concerned with the \\\\textit{utility} that the demand flexibility brings to\\nthe market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy. In this regard, we\\nprovide comprehensive predictive modeling and scheduling of demand flexibility\\nfrom household appliances to demonstrate the (financial and otherwise)\\nviability of introducing flexibility-based DR in the Danish/Nordic market.\\nFurther, we investigate the correlation between the potential utility and the\\naccuracy of the demand forecast model. Furthermore, we perform a number of\\nexperiments to determine the data granularity that provides the best financial\\nreward to market players for adopting the proposed DR scheme. A cost-benefit\\nanalysis of forecast results shows that even with somewhat low forecast\\naccuracy, market players can achieve regulation cost savings of 54% of the\\ntheoretically optimal.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-09-27\\nTitle: A City-centric Approach to Estimate and Evaluate Global Urban Air Mobility Demand\\nAuthors: Lukas Asmer, Roman Jaksche, Henry Pak, Petra Kokus\\nSummary: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is expected to effectively complement the existing\\ntransportation system by providing fast and safe travel options, contributing\\nto decarbonization, and providing benefits to citizens and communities.

Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPGMs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m allow us to understand by\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\textit\u001b[0m\u001b[32m{\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcausally\u001b[0m\u001b[32m}\u001b[0m\u001b[32m related. The\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\nfinancial markets.\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\nSources \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mRES\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m has severe \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfinancial and other\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m implications for energy market\\nplayers.

We evaluate the effectiveness and\\nfeasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility\\nanalysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is\\nmore concerned with the \\\\textit\u001b[0m\u001b[32m{\u001b[0m\u001b[32mutility\u001b[0m\u001b[32m}\u001b[0m\u001b[32m that the demand flexibility brings to\\nthe market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy.

Furthermore, we perform a number of\\nexperiments to determine the data granularity that provides the best financial\\nreward to market players for adopting the proposed DR scheme.

Alvi\\\\nSummary: The dissertation investigates the application of Probabilistic Graphical\\\\nModels (PGMs) in forecasting the price of Crude Oil.\\\\n  This research is important because crude oil plays a very pivotal role in the\\\\nglobal economy hence is a very critical macroeconomic indicator of the\\\\nindustrial growth. Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) allow us to understand by\\\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\\\\\textit{causally} related. The\\\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\\\nfinancial markets.\\\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\\\n\\\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\\\nSources (RES) has severe (financial and other) implications for energy market\\\\nplayers. In this paper, we present a device-level Demand Response (DR) scheme\\\\nthat captures the atomic (all available) flexibilities in energy demand and\\\\nprovides the largest possible solution space to generate demand/supply\\\\nschedules that minimize market imbalances. We evaluate the effectiveness and\\\\nfeasibility of widely used forecasting models for device-level flexibility\\\\nanalysis. In a typical device-level flexibility forecast, a market player is\\\\nmore concerned with the \\\\\\\\textit{utility} that the demand flexibility brings to\\\\nthe market, rather than the intrinsic forecast accuracy. In this regard, we\\\\nprovide comprehensive predictive modeling and scheduling of demand flexibility\\\\nfrom household appliances to demonstrate the (financial and otherwise)\\\\nviability of introducing flexibility-based DR in the Danish/Nordic market.\\\\nFurther, we investigate the correlation between the potential utility and the\\\\naccuracy of the demand forecast model. Furthermore, we perform a number of\\\\nexperiments to determine the data granularity that provides the best financial\\\\nreward to market players for adopting the proposed DR scheme. A cost-benefit\\\\nanalysis of forecast results shows that even with somewhat low forecast\\\\naccuracy, market players can achieve regulation cost savings of 54% of the\\\\ntheoretically optimal.\\\\n\\\\nPublished: 2023-09-27\\\\nTitle: A City-centric Approach to Estimate and Evaluate Global Urban Air Mobility Demand\\\\nAuthors: Lukas Asmer, Roman Jaksche, Henry Pak, Petra Kokus\\\\nSummary: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is expected to effectively complement the existing\\\\ntransportation system by providing fast and safe travel options, contributing\\\\nto decarbonization, and providing benefits to citizens and communities.

Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\\\\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\\\\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\\\\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mPGMs\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m allow us to understand by\\\\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\\\\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\\\\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\\\\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\\\\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\\\\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\\\\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\\\\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\\\\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\\\\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\\\\\\\textit\u001b[0m\u001b[32m{\u001b[0m\u001b[32mcausally\u001b[0m\u001b[32m}\u001b[0m\u001b[32m related. The\\\\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\\\\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\\\\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\\\\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\\\\nfinancial markets.\\\\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\\\\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\\\\n\\\\nPublished: 2018-05-02\\\\nTitle: Utilizing Device-level Demand Forecasting for Flexibility Markets - Full Version\\\\nAuthors: Bijay Neupane, Torben Bach Pedersen, Bo Thiesson\\\\nSummary: The uncertainty in the power supply due to fluctuating Renewable Energy\\\\nSources \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mRES\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m has severe \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mfinancial and other\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m implications for energy market\\\\nplayers.

       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become increasingly important in recent years, driven by growing demand in industries such as gaming, data centers, professional visualization, automotive, and more. This paper analyzes the current state of the global GPU market and makes predictions about future demand trends.\n",
       "\n",
       "Neupane et al. [1] discuss the importance of device-level demand forecasting for energy flexibility markets. While focused on a different domain, the principles of demand forecasting are relevant for the GPU market as well. Understanding the atomic level demand from various industries and generating accurate supply/demand schedules is critical.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Market Overview \n",
       "\n",
       "The global GPU market has experienced significant growth over the past decade. Some key statistics and facts:\n",
       "\n",
       "- In 2010, the GPU market was valued at $1.4 billion. By 2020, it had grown to $14.1 billion [2].\n",
       "- The market is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 22.8% from 2020 to 2025 [2].  \n",
       "- Major players include Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. Nvidia is the dominant supplier for AI hardware and software.\n",
       "- Gaming is the largest segment, followed by data centers and professional visualization.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alvi [3] highlights the importance of utilizing probabilistic graphical models for forecasting in complex markets with numerous factors at play, such as the crude oil market. The GPU market also has many interrelated demand drivers that could benefit from a similar approach to forecasting.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Demand Drivers\n",
       "\n",
       "Several factors are driving the increasing demand for GPUs globally:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Gaming** - The popularity of PC gaming and demand for high-performance graphics cards\n",
       "2. **Artificial Intelligence** - GPUs are essential for training and running AI/ML models\n",
       "3. **Remote Work** - The shift to remote work has accelerated demand for powerful computing  \n",
       "4. **Automotive** - GPUs are used in autonomous vehicles and infotainment systems\n",
       "5. **Cryptocurrencies** - GPUs are used in crypto mining, causing periodic surges in demand\n",
       "\n",
       "Asmer et al. [4] propose a city-centric approach to estimating global demand for urban air mobility. While in a different industry, the idea of bottom-up estimation from individual demand centers could potentially be applied to estimating global GPU demand by aggregating projections from key industries and geographic markets.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Future Predictions\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on an analysis of market data, the following predictions can be made about GPU demand over the next decade:\n",
